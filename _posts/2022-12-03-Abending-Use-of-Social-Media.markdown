Firstly, you should be in charge of yourself and go to socials on accordance of your timing. disadvantage - you might come in control of socials if you don't in control of yourself.

Secondly, you shouldn't logged in to any accounts and also store everything locally on your devices to avoid unnecessary internet access. advantage - probability of occuring on socials is very less cause you know when you loggedin and loggedout.


   - Who to follow, if you are poor then first target is to **get rich soon**, so follow those who you think can make you rich + they are already rich.

   - use ads blocker, cause nowadays political ads are F'ing with civilization.

   - you also don't want youtube to show what youtube want to show you rather you will use extension such as pocketube that can almost simulate youtube and also provide features that youtube don't provide us.

   - don't use twitter rather get notification of important tweets with email.

   - Instagram is for rich people, so poors are not allowed to *fuck around and find out*.

   - rather than syncing devices, store things locally use **Firefox Profile** to store your bookmarks, passwords, addons, history etc in single folder and just transfer Profiles locally to migrate to different devices.
